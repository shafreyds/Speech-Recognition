# Speech-Recognition


To develop a speech recognition system that converts text to speech and speech to text, you can utilize existing libraries and APIs. Here's an example implementation using the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech APIs:

1. Text to Speech (TTS):

In the code above, we import the texttospeech module from the Google Cloud library and create a client using texttospeech.TextToSpeechClient(). We define the input text that we want to convert to speech.

Next, we set the TTS voice and audio configuration. In this example, we use English (US) as the language and a neutral voice gender. We specify MP3 as the audio encoding.

We then synthesize the speech by calling client.synthesize_speech() and passing in the input text, voice, and audio configuration. The response object contains the synthesized audio content.

Finally, we save the synthesized speech to a file named output.mp3.

Make sure you have installed the google-cloud-texttospeech library (pip install google-cloud-texttospeech) and have the necessary credentials set up to use the Google Cloud APIs.

2. Speech to Text (STT):

In the code above, we import the speech_recognition library as sr and create a recognizer instance using sr.Recognizer().

We load the audio file that contains the speech input using sr.AudioFile() and record the audio using r.record(source).

We then perform speech recognition on the recorded audio by calling r.recognize_google(audio) which uses the Google Web Speech API to convert speech to text.

Finally, we print the recognized text.

Make sure you have installed the speechrecognition library (pip install SpeechRecognition) and have the necessary dependencies, such as pyaudio, installed to use the speech recognition capabilities.

You can modify and adapt these examples based on your specific requirements and available APIs or libraries for speech recognition and synthesis.
